// Build-time switches for the browser-playable itch.io DEMO.
//
// The demo is a WEB build (`DEMO=true npm run build:web`) served as static files
// on itch. It plays the real game against the hosted Harper (Harper-first), and
// if Harper can't be reached (offline / CORS) it falls back to the in-app solo
// backend so the demo still runs — see resolveDemoBackend() in src/api.ts.
//
// Scope of the demo: a caretaker restores the meadow until DEMO_ANIMAL_GOAL
// animals have returned, then the game hard-stops with a thank-you popup that
// returns to the title screen (see the demo gate in src/state.tsx + App.tsx).
//
// `typeof` keeps this safe in non-Vite contexts (e.g. Vitest), where the
// injected constant doesn't exist — there it falls back to `false`.
export const DEMO: boolean = typeof __DEMO__ !== 'undefined' ? __DEMO__ : false;

/** How many animals must return to the meadow before the demo hard-stops. */

/** The single biome the demo lets you work on (the starter meadow). */

/** Which product a metrics report belongs to, so dashboards can split demo vs
 *  paid players. Rides on heartbeats, app-open pings, and solo metric uplinks.
 *  Build-time only — a dev preview toggle (below) never tags real metrics. */

// Which backend the browser demo plays against:
//   'harper' — the hosted Harper is the source of truth (server-validated
//              gameplay), same as the full game. Still PASSWORDLESS: the demo
//              hides the passcode field, auto-generates one, and the server mints
//              a unique player id per demo save so anonymous players never collide
//              (see CreatePlayer's edition:'demo' path). Needs CORS for itch's
//              origin; if the hosted Harper can't be reached, it falls back to the
//              offline solo backend so the demo still runs.
//   'solo'   — fully-offline in-app backend (localStorage saves, no network to
//              play). Metrics still upload best-effort.
// Metrics are tagged edition:'demo' either way.
